# w1-semantic-refactoring

## Description

I have been tasked to increase the efficiency of the CSS by consolidating the selectors and properties, organising them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements and to include comments before each element or section of the page. Additionally, the user story also asked to create a codebase that follows accessibility standards so that the site is optimised for search engines. 

I feel that I have fulfilled these tasks to the best of my ability, as I've consolidated repetitive type selectors into grouping selectors and made code more semantically efficient in other ways. (Please refer to the refactoring section below.) I have also included comments throughout.
I feel that I have solved the problem of the website's non-optimised accessibility and search engine engagement by adding alt text to every image and giving the website a more appropriate title.

## Refactoring
Lessons learned about refactoring code based on the completion of this project:
- How to fix broken anchor links by attaching an Id to a section. 
- How to fix repeating code by combining repetitive type selectors into grouping selectors.
- How to convert images defined into CSS into HTML code. Doing this allowed me to add an alt text to this image.
- How to simplify a section class into an img class.
- The importance of ordering headings sequentially. 

I also learned to make classes more semantically convenient. Examples:
- Re-naming classes for better clarity (i.e. "benefit-lead" to "lead-generation" to create a more consistent naming scheme through out the entire code.)
- Changing a type selector into a descendent selector in order to make the purpose of the selector more semantically clear.

## Usage

As I can demonstrate in the screenshots below, despite a large portion of the code being changed the website still looks exactly the same as before. I have managed to improve the website's code functionality and accessibility without impacting on the visual design.

The links in the navigational bar successfully anchor link to the described sections of the page. 
The rest of the website is not interactive but all aspects of the website are displayed correctly. 

## Credits

I would like to thank my class mate Jack Stockwell who advised me through Slack how to move the banner image code from CSS into HTML so I could create alt text for that image. I also changed the banner from a section class to an img class based on his advice.

Other than that I heavily relied only lessons taught through the pre-module guide and the module 1 lessons of the course. I also did some minor googling to receive information that I did not use heavily enough to require attribution.
